# Things to remember while doing stuff

## Deleting
Make Sure do remove the things associated with the thing that you are deleting 

For example if you are deleting a User and that user has some posts written, make sure that you delete all the users posts and if in the application the user make some comments , make sure you delete them all to remove redundancy in your data.
